A Fox once saw a Crow fly off with a piece of cheese in its beak and settle on a
branch of a tree.

"That's for me, as I am a Fox," said Master Reynard, and he walked up to the foot
of the tree.

"Good day, Mistress Crow," he cried. "How well you are looking today: how glossy
your feathers; how bright your eye. I feel sure your voice must surpass that of 
other birds, just as your figure does; let me hear but one song from you that I 
may greet you as the Queen of Birds."

The Crow lifted up her head and began to caw her best, but the moment she opened
her mouth the piece of cheese fell to the ground, only to be snapped up by Master
Fox.

"That will do," said he. "That was all I wanted. In exchange for your cheese I 
will give you a piece of advice for the future: "Do not trust flatterers."
